# ShortestPath
The shortest route from one point to another has always been one of the most important aspect of travelling and commuting. Computer scientists have developed many algorithms to make travel easier for us. One such algorithm is Dijktra's Algorithm. It calculates the shortest path from one node to all other nodes. 
This project calculates the shortest path between one building on my university campus to another. I have created a simple graph to make it easy to understand Dijkstra's Algorithm. I have used numbers to depict the distances between the buildings. Keep in mind, Dijkstra's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm, which means it makes the best possible decision at every stage, which might not lead to an optimal solution in every case.
